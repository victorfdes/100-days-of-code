## Log

### R1D1 
Started an invoicing app. Configured Webpack and Babel. Planning to use React but going for a scratch build instead of create-react-app

### R1D2
Started with an infinite scroll app based on react. This one fetches and displays Music artist's info

### R1D3
Completed the infinite scroll app. Switched it from artist to song finder. Still needs a lot of updates. [View Online](https://victorfdes.github.io/artist-browser/)
